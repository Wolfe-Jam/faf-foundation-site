## Tactical Lessons From Anthropic's Rollout

| What They Did | What FAF Can Do |
|---------------|-----------------|
| Dedicated domain | standard.faf.one or spec.faf.one |
| "Developed by X" credibility | "IANA-registered. Anthropic MCP #2759. Chrome approved." |
| Logo wall of supporters | Claude, Gemini, Grok, Cursor, Chrome logos |
| GitHub-first | Position github.com/Wolfe-Jam/faf as THE spec repo |
| Validator tools | faf validate already exists - highlight it |
| Clear spec docs | Dedicated /spec page with full YAML schema |
| Integration guides | Step-by-step for each platform |

## The Gap (What FAF Has That Anthropic Doesn't)

**FAF's Advantages:**
- IANA registration (application/vnd.faf+yaml) - Anthropic doesn't have this
- 20K+ downloads (real adoption)
- Multi-platform support (proven across 8+ ecosystems)
- W3C group (governance)

**What's Needed:**
A clean site that tells the story like they do.

## Implementation Priority

3. **Spec page** - Full YAML schema with examples
4. **Integrations page** - Platform-specific guides
5. **Tools page** - CLI, MCP server, validators
