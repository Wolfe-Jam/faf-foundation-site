### Academic Whitepaper Published on CERN/Zenodo

A peer-citable technical whitepaper has been published on CERN's Zenodo research repository:

**Title:** Format-Driven AI Context Architecture: The .faf Standard for Persistent Project Understanding

**DOI:** [10.5281/zenodo.18251362](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18251362)

**Author:** James Wolfe Harrison (ORCID: 0009-0007-0801-3841)

The whitepaper presents empirical validation across 10,000+ projects and three major AI systems, demonstrating 99.7% faster context reconstruction compared to traditional documentation approaches.
